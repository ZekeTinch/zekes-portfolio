                    <p className = "text-lg mb-6 p-6"> My name is Ezekiel Tinch I live in Tennessee this course has been my first 
                experience with code and programming. Learning to use code and programming skills has 
                been on my radar for a long time i have always loved video games and wanted to learn 
                how they functioned. On top of that technology has always been an interest to me so 
                when the opportunity for this class appeared i jumped at it i have learned a lot and 
                there is still so much to learn outside of this class.
